## 🔥 Project Synopsis

**Console_BasedApplication** is a tech stacking of multiple **terminal/console applications** created in C, C++, Java, Python, and other languages.  
These applications demonstrate **fundamental programming logic**, **problem solving**, and **core application flow** using **command line interfaces**.

This repo is ideal for:
- Beginners learning **programming fundamentals**
- Developers who want **hands-on practice**
- Recruiters evaluating **practical code skills**

---

## 🧠 What Makes It Different?

Unlike typical projects:
✔ Each application is designed to run **entirely in terminal**  
✔ Provides **problem statement + working code**  
✔ Uses **command menus, navigation loops, and interactive prompts**  
✔ Multi-language support for comparison
